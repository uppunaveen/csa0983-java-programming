There are a few errors in the statements.

(a) There is no variable `x` declared or initialized, so this will result in a compile-time error.

(b) There are two syntax errors. First, there should be no apostrophes in the statement. Second, there should be a semicolon after `m=5`.

(c) This is not valid Java syntax. It looks like C++ syntax.

(d) There is a syntax error. The `\n` should be inside the quotation marks.

(e) There is a syntax error. The `+` should be inside the quotation marks.

(f) This statement is correct.

Here are the corrected statements:

(a) Declare and initialize `x` before using it.

(b) 
```
m = 5;
n = 10;
s = m;
```

(c) This is not valid Java syntax. It looks like C++ syntax.

(d) 
```
System.out.println("\nName: " + name);
```

(e) 
```
System.out.println("Enter the value: " + x);
```

(f) This statement is correct.
